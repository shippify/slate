# Introduction

Welcome to the Shippify API! You can use our API to access Shippify API endpoints, which can allow the creation and dispatching of real time deliveries and manage logistics for your e-commerce or online store.

We have language bindings in Shell for now. You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and in the future you will be able to switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.


# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:


```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>

# Tasks

## Get a Task


```shell
curl "https://services.shippify.co/task/info/:idtask"
